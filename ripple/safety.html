<title>Checksum Test</title>
</head>
<body>
  Since you are using this tool, you are trying to recover the secret to a wallet that has coins in it.
  <p>I don't know you, and you don't know me, and for all I know someone might have copied my code and inserted some malware before you ran it, so, here's
    how to be safe (admittedly probably over-cautious but never know):
  <ol>
    <li>This guide should have opened in a new tab. Tab back to the webpage that recovers your secret.</li>
    <li>Turn off wireless, turn on airplane mode, or unplug your network cable, so that nothing can be sent over the network.</li>
    <li>Use the page to recover your key (if anything breaks, don't trust it, my code should not break with the network off)</li>
    <li>Copy the new key down somewhere. Save it in a text file, or take a screenshot with your phone.</li>
    <li>Completely close the browser you used to recover the checksum.</li>
    <li>Turn on the network, and use the secret to recover your coins.</li>
    <li>Copy the coins into a different wallet, just in case.</li>
  </ol>

  The key is to turn the network off to ensure nobody can use your secret key before you do, and then drain the wallet just in case someone else ended up with
  your key even so.
